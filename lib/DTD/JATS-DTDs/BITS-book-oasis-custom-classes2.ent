    =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.0                (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-12-25)
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, and BITS modified to use
     the most recent version. No other changes to BITS were made.
 
 10. BITS remained version "2.0" but became "v2.0 20151225"
     JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"

    =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.0                (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-03-15)
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-03-01)

     BITS was modified, based on user feedback collected in 2014 
     and January/February 2015, according to the decisions
     made by the BITS Working Group. This DTD represents current 
     BITS and an interim version of the non-normative JATS DTD 
     Suite (version 1.1), as an indication to JATS users of 
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. 

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

 9. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
    - A new class to hold just the <option> element
    - Added <question-wrap-group> and <explanation>
       to the block display elements
    - Enhanced question-answer.class to also hold <explanation>
       and <question-wrap-group>

 8. BLOCK DISPLAY ELEMENTS - Three new elements added to the block
    display elements:
     - explanation
     - <name-address-wrap> (new element)
     - <question-wrap-group> (new element)

 7. ATTRIB - Created a new class to add the following elements
    to <attrib>:
      - collab
      - element-citation
      - mixed-citation
      - name
      - string-name

  6. SERIF HIGHLIGHTING - Added a new emphasis element <serif>,
     which means retain the serif nature of this content no
     matter what the surrounding text does. Typically used for
     variables in math, chemistry, and physics.

  5. REFERENCES LIST - Made a new class holding just the <ref-list>
     element, so that it can be added to the large OR group inside 
     <front-matter>, for example.

  4. FOOTNOTE GROUP CLASS - Made a new class to hold just
     the <fn-group> element, so it can be used in the model
     of Table of Contents, for example.

  3. BOOK APPENDIX AND BOOK APPENDIX GROUP
     - Created a new book-back-only class, modeled on 
       back-only class to hold the new element
       Book Appendix (<book-app>), a book-part-level appendix
       structure, as well as the other things that may be in 
       a <book-back>.
     - Revised book-back-only class to contain both the 
       <book-app> (Book Appendix) element and the <book-app-group>
       (grouping element for book-level appendices).

  2. BITS became version "2.0" and   "v2.0 20150630"
     JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20150301"

     =============================================================
     BITS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1    (2014-09-30)
     JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2  (2014-09-30)

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

  1. BITS became version "1.1" and   "v1.1 20140930//EN"
     JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
