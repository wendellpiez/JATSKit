[Formerly oXygenJATSframework]

oXygen XML Editor framework for NISO JATS 1.1 / NLM BITS. Now with
tools including XSLT and XProc that can be run independently of oXygen.

NISO JATS Z39.96-2012 defines an XML-based format for the authoring,
publication and archiving of journal articles and related information.
Its design is based on the NLM Journal Archiving and Publishing DTDs
through version 3.0.

The NLM BITS format is a closely related document model built to support
books (fairly broadly defined).

This oXygen framework supports editing JATS articles (v1.1) along with books
conformant to the specifications of BITS, the JATS-based NLM book tag set
(version 2.0 conformant with JATS 1.1). Included are DTDs, CSS files
for authoring, document templates, XSLT stylesheets and other utilities
for editing of JATS XML and production of HTML, PDF (preview) and EPUB outputs.

(Note: Outputs are explicitly not 'production grade', while not all formats 
are available for all document types. This toolkit does not aim for high 
production values, but serves as a starting point for further development
and refinement.)
