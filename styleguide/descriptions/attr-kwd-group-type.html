         <b>Keyword Authority</b>
      </h1>
      <p>This attribute is used with two different definitions:<ul>
            <li>
               <p>The most common is the name of the thesaurus, ontology, or organization that established a particular group of keywords, for example, “<code>MESH</code>”, “<code>ISO-463</code>”, “<code>IEEE</code>”, “<code>author-generated</code>”, “<code>ICD9-codes</code>”, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>The second usage describes the type of keyword  
for some of the more unusual keyword groups (for 
example, “<code>hierarchical</code>” 
for keywords that 
are grouped into a hierarchy, 
“<code>abbreviations</code>” for 
keywords that contain an abbreviation and its expansion, 
or “<code>code</code>” for 
keywords that contain a code 
and its text but where the source of the codes is unknown).</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
