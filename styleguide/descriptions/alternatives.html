         <code>&lt;alternatives&gt;</code> 
         <b>Alternatives For Processing</b>
      </h1>
      <p>Container element used to hold a group of processing alternatives, for example, a single <code>&lt;graphic&gt;</code> that ships in several formats (<code>tif</code>, <code>gif</code>, and <code>jpeg</code>) or in different resolutions. This element is a physical grouping to contain multiple logically equivalent (substitutable) versions of the same information object. Typically these are processing alternatives and the reader is expected to see only one version of the object.</p>
