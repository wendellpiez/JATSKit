         <b>Response</b>
      </h1>
      <p>Reply, response, or commentary concerning the journal article. In the typical case,
          the response is included in the same XML package as the original article, attached at the
          end of the article proper. Metadata that differs from that of the original article (for
          example, title, author), may be captured using the <code>&lt;front-stub&gt;</code> element; if the <code>&lt;front-stub&gt;</code> element is used, any metadata not
          specifically tagged is inherited from the original article.</p>
